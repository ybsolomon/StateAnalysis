# NY State Analysis Repo Setup

To commit large files (like our shp files), you'll need to install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com). This allows for files larger than 25MB to be uploaded to the repo.

Follow the steps on the website and track the following file extensions:
- .cpg
- .dbf
- .prj
- .shp
- .shx
